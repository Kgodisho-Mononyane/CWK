<h1>About Me</h1>  
<p>Hi! My name is Kgodisho Mononyane and I am 
    a self taught Web developer from Johannesburg,South Africa</p>
<p>I created this website to serve as an online archive 
    of my journey into web development and all the trials
    and tribulations I had to overcome in order to break into
    the industry. Follow along with me as I aim to distill the 
    knowledge and insights i've gained along the way.</p>
